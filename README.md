- `neither x nor y`
- `:test` command from REPL to run tests asynchronously and print basic results and way to follow them once they have resolved

## Roadmap

### repl

- carat showing position of actual error rather than arbitrarily at beginning of line
- type of results
- painless navigation
- helps for default functions

## Features
